    <h2>About us, the Creators</h2> 

    <p class="about"> We are a team of 3 humans located in Milwaukee, WI. My wife, my 4 month old daughter, and myself. We are originally a Smart Home company that offers Smart Home installation
    services and consultation, with a firm belief in the saying "Knowledge is power". This is why we have created this website. As part of the business training, we have to read
    a lot of articles on new technology and thourough training on installation of products.
    
    We have lived in Milwaukee for 3 years as a married couple, but for more than 20 years as individuals. We love to travel and have been to Toronto, Tokyo, Bangkok, Bahamas, and some
    other foreign cities.

    We will continue to update the webiste with feautures as we hear the request to do so. You can click <a href="contact.us" class="hcu">here</a> to contact us or on the botton and/or top of any page.
    Thank you to everyone who uses this and shares it! I hope you enjoy the website!

    <h2>All Time Favorites</h2>

    <p>I thought I'd share these. My all time favorite movie is Ready Player One. Mainly because this "Sci-Fi" movie isn't Sci-Fi at all. We are so close to having VR this advanced that it exites me so much!
     There will be nothing better than getting lost in a VR world, full of endless possibilities.

 <br><br>

 <p>To conclude, my all time favorite band is Skillet. Mainly because they're the best Christian rock band and also because they're known worldwide! Here's a popular song from them, Monster.</p>
